### LulaDirect SDK

LulaDirect lets you offer a branded shopping experience on your own website or app while benefiting from the same catalog, pricing, and order orchestration that power your marketplace channels.

### When to use LulaDirect

- You want a direct channel with no marketplace commissions
- You want a fast way to launch web or mobile ordering
- You want full control of branding and customer experience

### What it provides

- Prebuilt storefront components for web and mobile
- Cart, checkout, and order tracking flows
- Real‑time item availability tied to your Lula catalog
- Unified order queue and reporting alongside your other channels

### Getting access

Ask your Lula representative for SDK access. We will provision credentials and share implementation guidance for your chosen platform (web, iOS, or Android).

### Implementation overview

1) Configure your company and store IDs in Lula
2) Initialize the SDK with your credentials
3) Render the storefront components and test end‑to‑end
4) Launch with your preferred payments and fulfillment settings

If you already manage a custom front end, you can also integrate directly with the Lula APIs for catalog, menus, and orders instead of using the SDK components.
