## Step 1: Create Your Company and Store

Your organization needs to be set up in Lula before you can start selling. This involves creating a company record and at least one store location.

### Company Setup

If your organization isn't in Lula yet, your Lula contact will create it for you. For developers or those with API access:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Create Company
curl -X POST "https://api.lulacommerce.com/stores/company" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Your Company Name",
    "email": "contact@yourcompany.com",
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "address": {
      "line_1": "123 Main Street",
      "city": "Your City",
      "state": "Your State",
      "zip": "12345"
    }
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

ðŸ“– **Learn more:** [Create Company API](/api-reference/companies/create-company)

### Store Setup

Each physical location needs its own store record:

<CodeGroup>
```bash Create Store
curl -X POST "https://api.lulacommerce.com/stores/store/" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Your Store Name",
    "email": "store@yourcompany.com", 
    "phone_number": "+1234567890",
    "company_id": 1000001,
    "addresses": [
      {
        "line_1": "123 Store Street",
        "city": "Store City",
        "state": "Store State", 
        "zip": "54321",
        "address_type": 0
      }
    ]
  }'
```
</CodeGroup>

  -F "file=@your-products.csv" \
