### Getting started

This guide walks you through the fastest path to value: loading your products, creating a menu, and syncing to your sales channels.

### Before you begin

- A Lula account and access to your company and stores
- Your product list (CSV or JSON) with names, prices, and UPCs/SKUs
- The delivery channels you plan to use (DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, LulaDirect)

If you are missing access, request credentials from your Lula representative.

### Step 1: Create your company and store

If your organization is not yet in Lula, your Lula contact will create it. Otherwise, confirm your store details are correct. Developers can use the API to create these records:

- Create a company: see [Create company](/api-reference/companies/create-company)
- Create a store: see [Create store](/api-reference/stores/create-store)

### Step 2: Load your products

Choose the format that’s easiest for you today—you can always change later:

- CSV import: see [Upload CSV](/api-reference/catalog/upsert-products-csv)
- JSON import: see [Upload JSON](/api-reference/catalog/upsert-products-json)
- Update inventory and prices: see [Upsert inventory](/api-reference/catalog/upsert-inventory)

After import, you can verify items with [Get store inventory](/api-reference/catalog/get-store-inventory).

### Step 3: Build your menu

Create a store menu and link the right items. You can do this in the dashboard or via API:

- Create or update a store menu: [Create menu](/api-reference/menus/create-store-menu) and [Upsert menu](/api-reference/menus/upsert-store-menu)
- Manage menu items: [Create menu item](/api-reference/menus/menu-items/create-menu-item)
- Set menu schedules: [Get menu timings](/api-reference/menus/get-store-menu-timings)

### Step 4: Sync to channels

When your menu looks right, publish it to your connected channels:

- Sync menus for all stores: [Sync menus](/api-reference/menus/sync-menu-for-all-stores)

You can confirm the active menus with [Get active menus](/api-reference/menus/get-all-active-menu-of-store) and [Get menu list](/api-reference/menus/get-menu-list).

### Step 5: Test an order

Use a marketplace sandbox or place a small real order to validate the full flow:

- Watch incoming orders: [Get incoming orders](/api-reference/orders/get-incoming-orders)
- Accept and fulfill: [Accept order](/api-reference/orders/accept-incoming-order)
- See order details: [Get order details](/api-reference/orders/get-order-details)

### Environments

Lula supports sandbox and production environments. Confirm which you are using before sharing links or placing orders. Ask your Lula contact for sandbox access if you don’t have it yet.

### What’s next

- Fine‑tune item availability and modifiers
- Set taxes and fees: [Get store tax rate](/api-reference/stores/get-store-tax-rate)
- Launch promotions and campaigns: [Campaigns overview](/api-reference/campaigns/campaigns-overview)
