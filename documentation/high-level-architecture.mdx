### Lula at a glance

Lula Commerce sits between your stores and every delivery channel, acting as a single source of truth for products, menus, and orders. You manage items and pricing once in Lula; we publish consistent data everywhere and consolidate activity back into one place.

### Core components

- Menu service: builds store‑specific menus, schedules, and availability windows
- Orders service: receives, acknowledges, and tracks orders end‑to‑end
- Campaigns & promotions: applies discounts and offers across channels
- Connectors: synchronize menus and orders with DoorDash, Uber Eats, Grubhub, and LulaDirect
- Webhooks & notifications: push updates to your systems in real time
