## Lula at a Glance

Lula Commerce sits between your stores and every delivery channel, acting as a **single source of truth** for products, menus, and orders. You manage items and pricing once in Lula; we publish consistent data everywhere and consolidate activity back into one place.

<Info>
This centralized approach eliminates data inconsistencies and reduces the operational overhead of managing multiple delivery platforms independently.
