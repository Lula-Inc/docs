## Integrations Overview

Lula connects your stores to major delivery channels so you can **manage one catalog and menu** and sell everywhere. Below is a high-level view of what each integration supports. Details vary by partner and region, but the workflows are similar.

<Info>
With Lula's unified approach, you configure once and reach customers across all major platforms without managing multiple integrations separately.
