title: "Accept Incoming Order"
api: "PUT {{orders_api_base_url}}/orders/accept/"
description: "Accept an incoming order from a delivery service platform and initiate the fulfillment process."
playground : "simple"
---

This endpoint allows stores to formally accept incoming orders from delivery platforms like DoorDash, UberEats, and Grub Hub. Accepting an order initiates the fulfillment workflow and notifies the delivery platform that the order is being processed.

<Info>
Once an order is accepted, it cannot be rejected through normal processes. Use the cancel order endpoint if you need to cancel after acceptance.

<Accordion title="Order Acceptance Workflow">
When an order is accepted, the following happens automatically:

1. **Status Update**: Order status changes from "pending" to "accepted"
2. **Platform Notification**: The delivery platform (DoorDash, UberEats, etc.) is notified
3. **Fulfillment Creation**: A new fulfillment record is created for tracking
4. **Timer Start**: Preparation timer begins for performance metrics
5. **Inventory Hold**: Items are reserved in inventory (if applicable)
6. **Staff Notification**: Kitchen/preparation staff are notified of new order
</Accordion>

<Warning>
**Time Sensitive**: Orders typically have acceptance windows (usually 10-15 minutes). Failing to accept within this window may result in automatic cancellation by the delivery platform.
</Warning>

<Tip>
**Best Practice**: Always provide realistic estimated_ready_time values. Accurate timing improves customer satisfaction and delivery platform ratings.
</Tip>

<Note>
If you don't provide an estimated_ready_time, the system will calculate one based on your store's historical preparation times and current order volume.
</Note>
