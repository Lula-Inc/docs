<Accordion title="Cancellation Process Workflow">
When an order is canceled, the following automated processes occur:

1. **Order Status Update**: Status changed to "canceled"
2. **Inventory Release**: Any reserved inventory is released back to available stock
3. **Refund Initiation**: Automatic refund processing begins
4. **Platform Notification**: Delivery platform is notified with reason
5. **Customer Notification**: Customer receives cancellation notification
6. **Analytics Update**: Cancellation metrics are updated for reporting
7. **Audit Trail**: Complete cancellation record is created for compliance
</Accordion>

<Note>
**Refund Timing**: Refunds typically process within 3-5 business days, but the exact timing depends on the customer's payment method and the delivery platform's policies.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Best Practice**: When possible, contact the customer directly before canceling to explore alternatives or explain the situation. This can help maintain customer satisfaction even in difficult situations.
