<Info>
**Usage Tips:**
- Use without parameters to get an overview of all companies and their store counts
- Include `company_id` parameter to get detailed information for a specific company
- The `stores_count` field helps you understand the scale of each company's operations
- `point_of_contact` field may be null if no contact person is assigned
</Info>

<Warning>
Some companies may have null values for status or point_of_contact fields. Always check for null values when processing the response.
