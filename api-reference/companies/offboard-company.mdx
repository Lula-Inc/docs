This endpoint starts the offboarding process for a company, which is a safer alternative to permanent deletion. Offboarding allows for a controlled wind-down of operations while maintaining data integrity and compliance requirements.

### What is Offboarding?

Offboarding is a structured process that:
- Gracefully transitions the company out of active service
- Preserves historical data for compliance and reporting
- Ensures proper closure of ongoing operations
- Maintains audit trails for business purposes
- Allows for potential reactivation if needed

<Info>
**Offboarding vs Deletion:** Unlike deletion, offboarding preserves all company data while marking the company as no longer active. This approach is recommended for compliance and business continuity.
