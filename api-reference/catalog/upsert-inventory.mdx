### Response

<Note>
This endpoint processes the inventory updates asynchronously. No immediate response body is provided.
</Note>

The system will process your inventory updates in the background. Changes will be reflected in your store's inventory once processing is complete.

<Tip>
Setting quantity to 0 will mark the product as out of stock. Use "inactive" status to temporarily disable a product from being sold.
</Tip>
