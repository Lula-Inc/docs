Modifier groups are powerful tools that allow you to create customizable product options. They enable customers to personalize their orders by selecting from predefined choices like sizes, add-ons, cooking preferences, and other variations.

## What are Modifier Groups?

Modifier groups organize related customization options into logical categories. For example:
- **Size Options**: Small, Medium, Large
- **Add-ons**: Extra cheese, bacon, avocado
- **Preparation**: Rare, medium, well-done
- **Flavors**: Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry

## Key Components

The container that defines:
- **Quantity Rules**: Minimum and maximum selections required
- **Pricing Rules**: Free options vs. premium add-ons
- **Display Order**: How options appear to customers
- **Status**: Active or inactive modifier groups

### Modifier Options
Individual choices within a group:
- **Store Items**: Products that serve as customization options
- **Pricing**: Additional cost for premium options
- **Availability**: Active or inactive options

### Item Mappings
