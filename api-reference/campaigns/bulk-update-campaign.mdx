This endpoint allows you to apply the same updates to multiple campaigns at once, streamlining campaign management for scenarios where you need to modify several campaigns with identical changes.

<Info>
Bulk updates are processed as a single transaction. If any campaign update fails, the entire operation is rolled back to maintain data consistency.

<Accordion title="Bulk Update Process">
The bulk update process follows these steps:

1. **Validation**: All campaign IDs are validated for existence and permissions
2. **Pre-Check**: Updates are validated against business rules for each campaign
3. **Transaction Start**: Database transaction begins to ensure consistency
4. **Sequential Updates**: Each campaign is updated in sequence
5. **Error Handling**: Any failures trigger rollback of all changes
6. **Confirmation**: Successful completion commits all changes
7. **Notification**: Affected systems are notified of changes
</Accordion>

<Note>
**Transaction Safety**: Bulk updates use database transactions to ensure either all campaigns are updated successfully or none are modified, maintaining data consistency.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Performance Consideration**: For large numbers of campaigns (>50), consider breaking the update into smaller batches to avoid timeout issues and improve processing speed.
</Tip>

### Best Practices

<Accordion title="Bulk Update Best Practices">

**Planning**
- Test bulk updates on a small subset first
- Verify campaign IDs before executing large updates
- Consider timing of updates relative to customer activity

**Data Validation**
- Ensure all update fields are valid for all target campaigns
- Check date ranges and status transitions for consistency
- Validate permissions for all campaigns being updated

**Monitoring**
- Monitor system performance during large bulk updates
- Track success rates and error patterns
- Set up alerts for bulk update failures

**Recovery Planning**
- Have rollback procedures ready for failed updates
- Maintain backups before large bulk operations
- Document changes for audit and troubleshooting

</Accordion>

### Limitations

<Accordion title="Bulk Update Limitations">

**Campaign Limits**
- Maximum 100 campaigns per bulk update request
- Processing timeout after 5 minutes
- Memory limitations for very large updates

**Field Restrictions**
