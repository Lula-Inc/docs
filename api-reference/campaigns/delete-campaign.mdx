<Accordion title="Deletion Process Workflow">
When a campaign is deleted, the following occurs in sequence:

1. **Validation**: Verify deletion permissions and campaign status
2. **Promotion Deactivation**: Immediately stop all active promotions
3. **Store Disassociation**: Remove campaign from all associated stores
4. **Data Archival**: Create backup of all campaign data (if enabled)
5. **Record Deletion**: Remove campaign and related records from active database
6. **Cache Invalidation**: Clear all cached campaign data across systems
7. **Audit Logging**: Record deletion event for compliance and tracking
</Accordion>

<Note>
**Data Archival**: By default, campaign data is archived before deletion. This allows for potential data recovery and historical analysis while removing the campaign from active systems.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Alternative to Deletion**: Consider setting campaign status to "inactive" or "archived" instead of deletion to preserve historical data while removing the campaign from customer-facing systems.
</Tip>
