</Accordion>

### Business Logic

<Accordion title="Active Menu Business Rules">

**Menu Activation Criteria**
- Menu must have "active" status
- Store must be operational and accessible
- Menu configuration must be complete and valid
- Operating hours must be properly configured

**Time-Based Availability**
- Active menus may still be time-restricted
- Operating hours determine actual customer access
- Special schedules may override default availability
- Holiday and event schedules affect menu access

**Priority and Default Handling**
- Default menus take precedence in customer displays
- Menu priority affects ordering in lists
- Specialized menus may override default options
- Business rules determine menu presentation order

**Dynamic Updates**
- Menu status changes are reflected immediately
- Real-time updates ensure accurate customer information
- System synchronization maintains consistency
- Operational changes are propagated quickly

</Accordion>

### Error Scenarios

<Accordion title="Common Error Handling">

**No Active Menus**
```json
{
  "message": "No active menus found for this store",
  "data": [],
  "store_id": "store-123"
