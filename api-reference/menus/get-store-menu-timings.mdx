### Timing Calculation Logic

<Accordion title="How Menu Timing Works">

**Daily Schedule Processing**
- Each menu can have multiple time periods per day
- Days of the week are processed independently
- Closed days are clearly identified in timing data
- Special schedules override default timing

**Current Time Evaluation**
- System compares current time to menu operating hours
- Time zone conversion ensures accurate local time comparison
- Overlap periods are handled for complex schedules
- Transition times are calculated for opening/closing events

**Future Availability Prediction**
- Next available period calculation for closed menus
- Remaining operating time for currently open menus
- Weekly schedule projection for advance planning
- Holiday and special event schedule integration

**Complex Schedule Handling**
- Multiple opening periods per day (e.g., lunch breaks)
- Overnight operations crossing midnight
- Seasonal schedule variations
- Emergency schedule modifications

</Accordion>
