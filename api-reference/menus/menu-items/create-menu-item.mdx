<Accordion title="Menu Item Management Strategies">

**Category-Based Management**
- Add entire product categories to menus efficiently
- Maintain category associations for new items
- Simplify menu management for large inventories
- Enable automatic inclusion of new category items

**Individual Item Control**
- Precise control over specific item visibility
- Override category-based inclusions with specific exclusions
- Handle special items that don't fit standard categories
- Support custom menu configurations

**Hybrid Approach**
- Combine category and individual item management
- Use category inclusion with specific item exclusions
- Create complex menu structures with precise control
- Balance efficiency with customization needs

</Accordion>

<Note>
**Inclusion Priority**: Individual item inclusions and exclusions take precedence over category-based selections, allowing for fine-tuned menu control.
</Note>

<Tip>
**Batch Operations**: Use multiple menu_ids to apply the same item configuration across several menus simultaneously, improving efficiency for multi-menu updates.
</Tip>

### Use Cases

<Accordion title="Common Menu Item Creation Scenarios">

**Specialized Menu Creation**
- Create breakfast menus with specific morning items
- Build lunch menus excluding breakfast-only products
- Design dinner menus with premium items
- Develop limited-time offer menus with promotional items

**Category-Based Menu Building**
- Include entire beverage category in all menus
- Add all dessert items to dinner menus
- Include fresh produce in healthy eating menus
- Add seasonal items to special event menus

**Selective Item Management**
- Exclude high-cost items from discount menus
- Include only available items in current inventory menus
- Add featured items to promotional menus
- Remove discontinued items from all menus

**Multi-Menu Coordination**
- Apply consistent item sets across franchise locations
- Coordinate promotional items across multiple menus
- Standardize core offerings while allowing customization
- Manage inventory-driven menu changes

</Accordion>

### Item Selection Logic

<Accordion title="How Item Selection Works">

**Processing Order**
1. **Category Inclusion**: All items from specified categories are added
2. **Individual Inclusion**: Specific items from included_ids are added
3. **Exclusion Processing**: Items in excluded_ids are removed
4. **Final Validation**: Ensure all included items are valid and available

**Conflict Resolution**
- Excluded items override category inclusions
- Individual inclusions override category-based exclusions
- Invalid item IDs are silently skipped
- Empty arrays are processed without errors

**Inventory Integration**
- Only available inventory items can be included
- Out-of-stock items may be automatically excluded
- Seasonal availability affects item inclusion
- Real-time inventory updates influence menu item visibility

</Accordion>

### Validation Rules

<Accordion title="Menu Item Validation">

**Menu Validation**
- All menu IDs must exist and belong to the specified store

**Item Validation**
- All item IDs must correspond to valid inventory items
- Items must be available for the store location
- Items must be compatible with menu requirements
- Category IDs must exist in the store's catalog

**Business Rules**
- Alcohol items may require special menu designation
- Age-restricted items need appropriate menu labeling
- Seasonal items are validated for current availability
- Promotional items require valid campaign associations
