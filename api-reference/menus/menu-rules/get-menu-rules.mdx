### Rule Evaluation Process

<Accordion title="How Rules Are Processed">

**Evaluation Sequence**
1. **Condition Assessment**: All rule conditions are evaluated against current context
2. **Priority Sorting**: Applicable rules are sorted by priority (highest first)
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Higher priority rules override lower priority ones
4. **Action Execution**: Rule actions are applied in priority order
5. **Result Validation**: Final menu state is validated for consistency

**Context Evaluation**
- Current date and time are compared against rule conditions
- Inventory levels are checked against rule thresholds
- Weather data is evaluated for weather-dependent rules
- Customer segment information is used for targeted rules
- Staff and operational data is considered for operational rules

**Conflict Resolution**
- Rules with the same priority are processed in creation order
- Explicit exclusions override general inclusions
- Availability rules take precedence over display rules
- Safety and compliance rules have highest priority

**Performance Optimization**
- Rules are cached and evaluated efficiently
- Only applicable rules are processed based on current context
- Rule evaluation results are cached for consistent application
- System monitors rule performance and execution times
